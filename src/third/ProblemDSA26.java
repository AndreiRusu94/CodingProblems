/*
Given an integer array of coins[] of size n representing different types of denominations and an integer sum, the task is to count all combinations of coins to make a given value sum.

Note: Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin.

Examples:

Input: sum = 4, coins[] = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four solutions: [1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 2] and [1, 3]

Input: sum = 10, coins[] = [2, 5, 3, 6]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are five solutions:
[2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 3, 3], [2, 2, 6], [2, 3, 5] and [5, 5]

Input: sum = 10, coins[] = [10]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only is to pick 1 coin of value 10.

Input: sum = 5, coins[] = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation:  We cannot make sum 5 with the given coins
